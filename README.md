# Assignment 1
Question 1.
Steps:
1. Initialize a variable named "result" to store the length of the longest substring found.
2. Iterate through the characters of the first string to compare them with characters from the second string.
3. Initialize variable "f" to store the current length of the common substring.
4. Nested Loop: Iterate over the characters of the second string for each character in the first string.
5. If characters in two strings match, "f" is incremented by one. 
6. If "f" is greater than the "result", replace the result with the value "f". 
7. Repeat this process until all characters in the two strings match.
8. Returns the value stored in the result variable that represents the length of the longest substring.

Question 2.
Steps to run the program:
1. Define two matrices arr1 and arr2 with their dimensions row1, col1, row2, col2.
2. Ensure the number of columns in arr1 matches the number of rows in arr2.
3. Call the function matrixMultiplication(arr1, row1, col1, arr2, row2, col2) with the matrices and dimensions as arguments.
4. Check the output
